bayes: 167 best-scoring unpartitioned trees; 88 of which were 100+, 27 500+  lnL higher
raxml: 63 best-scoring unpartitioned trees; 11 of which are 100+, 3 500+ lnL higher

bayes: 116 of the best-scoring partitioned trees, 24 of which are 100+, 3 500+
raxml: 19 of the best-scoring partitioned trees,  8 of which are 100+, 1 500+

Bayes:
AICc       91
BIC        27
unpart    52  [trees for which all three metrics are worse: on chart bayes_final, there are 156 trees below 0, relecting this]
interpretation: in 20% of cases, even though a partition scheme is favored, unpartitioned data performs better. In all cases in which Bayesian estimation outperforms RAxML, partitioning improves score.

RAX:
AIC         169
AICC         42
BIC          45
unpart      3 [for which all three metrics are worse, but there are bars where individual metrics are worse on rax_final]
interpretation: in <1% of data sets did partitioning not improve data estimation.
